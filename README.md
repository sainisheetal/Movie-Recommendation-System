# Movie-Recommendation-System

The mission
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The mission is to create a recommendation tool for movies and TV shows that an user can interact with.

The tool will take as input the user's favorite movies and shows and recommend new ones in a user friendly manner. You are allowed to use additional resources and incorporate other features that are interesting for users.


Steps:
1. Data Preprocessing/EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Analyse the data for more details and cleaned it. Droped some columns which i am not going to use further. However, I have not cleaned completly as i am going to 
use Powerbi and using power query to clean the rest of the fields. 


3. Creating the TF-IDF Matrix
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The TF-IDF matrix using sklearn 
  The cosine similarity matrix using sklearn
  
4. Dashboard
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dashboard
![Dashboard](https://github.com/sainisheetal/Movie-Recommendation-System/blob/main/PowerBi/Movie%20Recommendation%20dashboard.png)
I have used Powerbi desktop to build this dashboard. This dashboard shows details related to movies. It also shows in which country movies shooting happen under which production house. It shows which movie is popular, have maximum vote and rating.


In below dashboard, User can see the suggestions prescribed by the system on the basis of search. As shown, if i enter initial words its shows movies starting with same alphabets and also recommend list of Action movies (related movies).

Limitations
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I am using the free version which has some less functionality. If we work on paid version we will be able to publish our reports and dashboards.
