# Movie-Recommendation-System

The mission
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You are part of the data team for the Internet Movie Database (IMDB). Your task is to create a recommendation tool for movies and TV shows that an user can interact with.

The tool will take as input the user's favorite movies and shows and recommend new ones in a user friendly manner. You are allowed to use additional resources and incorporate other features that are interesting for users.

The goal is to have a working minimum viable product (MVP) by the end of the project. Each member (or team) in the group should submit a project outline of their MVP on by end of Day 1 to the coach for review and feedback.
